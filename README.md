Oh hai.

Here be a few bash files that I've collected, written, and use. Feel free to utilize as well!

Here are some other very cool script repos:

**Script Descriptions**

* `rackspace-clouddb-backup.sh` -- This script lets you set a nightly backup schedule for your Cloud Databases. A feature that is currently not available outside of the Rackspace API. You will need your Account Name and API key.

* `slack-stream-images-webhook.sh` - this script queries a folder for any changes and posts images to a Slack channel using the Slack webhook api. Set a cron job to run this all the time and voila! Enjoy the data.

* `cleanfiles.sh` - super simple script that runs once a day and deletes files older than 24 hours in x folder.

* `directorytotxt.sh` - another simple script that you can use to extract a list of file names and dump them to a txt file
